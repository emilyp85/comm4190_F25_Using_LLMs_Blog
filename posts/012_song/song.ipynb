    "# Introduction\n",
    "Inspired by the debate on Taylor Swift's new album, *The Life of a Showgirl*, and the debate about Taylor Swift using AI to generate her songs, I want to see if ChatGPT can compose a song for me. I am going to ask if it can generate a beat as well as a melody. Using the beats and melody, I will then ask ChatGPT to see if it can generate lyrics for the song. I want to see what kind of lyrics it will generate and the story the lyrics will tell. Would it be creative? Would it be an upbeat song? Or a depressing, romantic song? Where or who would ChatGPT draw inspiration from ‚Äî Taylor Swift or Kanye West? Or lesser known artists?\n",

    "# Analysis\n",
    "The start was strong. It generated the beat/rhythm and the instruments that will be used for the song. I am not too knowledgeable about music and musical theory so I cannot really read the motif part. For the lyrics, it seem to fit the genre but the lyrics seem very cliche and superficial‚Äîthere's not much storytelling going on and it sounds like every other pop song. I was hoping for something more creative.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Expanding Further\n",
    "ChatGPT asked me this.\n",
    "> Would you like me to generate an actual audio file (a rough beat + melody demo) based on this song?\n",
    "I can create a short 20‚Äì30 second instrumental version to match the mood and structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "I, of course, said \"Yes.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT then asked me to clarify what I wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perfect üé∂\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I generate the audio, could you tell me a bit more about your vision so I can tailor the sound? For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vibe** ‚Äì should it sound more like\n",
    "\n",
    "   * üí§ *Lo-fi / bedroom pop* (soft synths, mellow beat),\n",
    "   * üé∏ *Indie pop / live band* (guitar, bass, light drums), or\n",
    "   * üéß *R&B / chillwave* (smooth bass, subtle percussion, dreamy pads)?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Vocal style** ‚Äì do you want it to sound like\n",
    "\n",
    "   * a male or female vocalist,\n",
    "   * breathy / emotional or clean / melodic?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Length** ‚Äì short demo (20‚Äì30s), or a fuller loop (~1 minute)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I have that, I‚Äôll generate the audio clip for *‚ÄúLate Light.‚Äù*\n",

    "There was no audio I could play anywhere it was just a png file, which is not what I wanted. So, I naturally asked ChatGPT to see if it can generate an audio for it.\n",

    "The following is its response.\n",
    "\n",
    "I can‚Äôt directly *generate or play audio files* in this chat, but I can absolutely help you **create the audio** for ‚ÄúLate Light‚Äù using tools you already have ‚Äî like GarageBand, BandLab, or Logic.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "In conclusion, it was fun to be a composer for a day using ChatGPT but true talent of an artist lies elsewhere than artificial intelligence. I don't think any artist, or aspiring artist who wish to make a name for themselves, should use artificial intelligence to generate their songs because the songs it generates is not very good. I wonder if ChatGPT was able to generate an audio for \"Late Night,\" if it would be catchy like some of Taylor Swift's songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, I wonder if there is anything creative that ChatGPT can do successfully, which I will continue to explore through my blog posts."
