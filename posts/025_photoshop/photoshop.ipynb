    "# Introduction\n",
    "Inspired by my \"Gemini\" post, I decided to see if Gemini can photoshop my photos accurately. I wanted to see if it can make my photo fit a certain aesthetic by editing and photoshopping it. I will assess the quality of the photo as well as how realistic it looks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the original photo I will be using.\n",
    "![](unnamed.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "# First Edit\n",
    "I asked Google Gemini to see if it can make the lighting of the photo bluish gray in order to fit the aesthetic or vibe of my Instagram page.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what it gave me:\n",
    "![](lighting.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It actually did a great job. The lighting looks very realistic. The only caveat would be that it made the photo seem like it was taken in black and white because the color of myself and the floor has been sapped. Thus, I requested a new change.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Second Edit\n",
    "Then, I asked Google Gemini to see if it can keep the color of the floor and myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what Gemini said: \"Okay, I will keep the colors of yourself and the floor while changing the lighting of the background elements to grayish blue.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![](second.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I was pleasantly surprised. The editing looks very realistic, like someone professionally photoshoped this. It give me exactly what I was looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Final Edit\n",
    "In order to fit my Instagram feed aesthetic better, I asked Gemini to tone down the exposure and add a bit more blue hues to the photo. This is the photo that Google Gemini gave me:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](final.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analysis\n",
    "Overall, Gemini's photo editing skills exceeded my expectations. Google Gemini's ability to provide a photo was faster than that of ChatGPT, which I really appreciated; I didn't want to wait minutes every time I requested an edit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In my first edit, while Gemini successfully achieved the bluish-gray lighting I asked for, the result looked slightly desaturated and black and white_almost monochromatic. this showed me that Gemini, while understanding the \"color tone\" direction, did not understand the nuance of preserving natural skin tones and small details.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second edit demonstrated a significant improvement in accuracy. Gemini managed to isolate and preserve the original colors of myself and the floor while still adjusting the background lighting to match my first request. This result looked much more professional and cohesive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the third and final edit achieved the exact edit and aesthetic I was looking for. The lowered exposure and subtle increase in blue hues gave the image of a moody, cohesive vibe that would better fit my Instagram profile. The shadows and highlights also appeared balanced, maintaing a realistic feel rather than an AI feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, Gemini's editing quality was surprisingly high for an AI model when compared to ChatGPT."
