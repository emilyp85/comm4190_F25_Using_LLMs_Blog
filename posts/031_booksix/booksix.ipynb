    "# Update as of Nov. 15\n",
    "As of November 15, I have finished *Unmasking AI*. I surprisingly enjoyed the conclusion of the book. While most of the book was repeating the same things-that awareness of bias in LLMs are important—the conclusion focused a bit more on the practicality and solutions in addressing the problem, whether through legislation or otherwise. I found it insightful that the author discussed both legislative avenues and alternative strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another highlight for me was the poem Dr. Buolamwini included at the very end of the book. I really enjoyed taking the time to analyze it, paying attention to the rhetorical devices and stylistic choices she employed, such as juxtaposition, Greek references, and repetitions. It added a reflective and creative touch that complemented the analytical content of the rest of the book.\n",

    "# Questions and Answers\n",
    "1) **What does she suggest about the relationship between beauty standards and algorithmic accuracy?**\n",
    "Bolamwini argues that algorithmic systems, particularly facial recognition technologies, often perform better on faces that align with conventional beauty standards. These standards—shaped historically by Eurocentric ideals—skew training datasets toward Eurocentric features like lighter skin and certain noses. As a result, AI systems are less accurate at recognizing darker-skinned faces, nonbinary or gender-nonconforming individuals, and faces that fall outside these normative standards. She suggests that this shows how technology inherits societal biases rather than being inherently \"objective.\"\n",
    "   \n",
    "2) **How does she use the idea of visibility vs. erasure—both in terms of race and credibility—as a recurring theme?**\n",
    "Buolamwini repeatedly highlights the tension between visibility and erasure. In terms of race, she shows how people of color are often \"erased\" by AI systems. Similarly, in terms of credibility, marginalized voices and experiences are often ignored or dismissed in conversations like AI ethics and policy. By using the idea of visibility vs. erasure, she emphasizes that invisibility isn't just a societal issue but is technologically mediated, affecting both recognition and representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **How does she illustrate the dangers of assuming technology as neutral?**\n",
    "The author illustrates the risks of assuming AI is neutral through multiple examples. She shows that algorithms reflect the data they are trained on and the priorities of their designers. For instance, facial recognition systems may misidentify women of color at disproportionately high rates, not because the technology is flawed in principle, but because the datasets and development processes are biased. By documenting these failures, she warns that treating technology as neutral can hide structural inequalities, reinforce discrimination, and lead to real-world harms.\n",

    "# Final Takeaways\n",
    "I really liked this assignment, *Living with a Book*. It's been so long since I carried around a physical book for me to read, even longer since I annotated directly on the book's pages. It brought back memories from middle school when my teachers had me annotating my book assignments using different colored highlighters each for specific annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment inspired me to start carrying around books I want to read and buy physical copies from my local bookstore. In the digital, media era we currently live in, I don't get many opportunities to do so—as most students like me prefer to download their textbooks and reading assignments on their laptops rather than carry around a heavy copy. Overall, this experience reminded me of the unique satisfaction and engagement that comes from interacting with a physical book, and I hope to continue making reading a tangible, deliberate part of my daily life."
