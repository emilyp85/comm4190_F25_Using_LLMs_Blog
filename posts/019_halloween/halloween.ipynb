    "# Introduction\n",
    "In honor of Halloween, I decided to depend on ChatGPT's creativity and ask it for help. I wanted ChatGPT to generate some costume ideas that I can use for Halloween this year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt I asked ChatGPT was: \"Please generate some costume ideas I can use for Halloween this year. Please go with trendy costumes but something that does not require too much effort or props. I want something people can recognize but is not basic.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# ChatGPT's Response:\n",
    "Got it! You want trendy, recognizable, not too “basic,” and low-effort. Here’s a list of ideas you could pull off without a ton of props:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pop Culture / TV & Movies**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Wednesday Addams (Netflix)** – Black dress, white collar, braids. Iconic and easy.\n",
    "2. **Barbie from *Barbie* (2023 movie)** – Pink everything, cute sunglasses. Glam but low-effort.\n",
    "3. **AI Chatbot/“ChatGPT”** – Wear a shirt with code, carry a fake laptop, maybe a speech bubble with “I’m here to help.” Nerdy, topical, and funny.\n",
    "4. **Wednesday vs. Barbie Mashup** – Dark gothic dress + pink accessories. Trendy meme-ready.\n",
    "5. **Wednesday as a Baddie (meme version)** – Black outfit + edgy makeup + oversized blazer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Music / Pop Stars**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Taylor Swift “Eras Tour” look** – Pick one iconic era outfit (like sparkly, glittery, or cowboy boots). Easy to recognize.\n",
    "7. **Billie Eilish “Green Hair” Look** – Neon hair (wig works), baggy clothes, and chains. Effortless.\n",
    "8. **K-Pop Idol Inspired** – Oversized blazers, pastel hair, cute accessories. Recognizable to fans but approachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Internet / Meme Culture**\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Dalle-Generated AI Art** – Print a funny or surreal AI image, tape it to yourself, or carry it as a sign. Hilarious and meta.\n",
    "10. **TikTok Trend Costume** – Pick a viral dance trend or viral sound (like the “Ratatouille musical” outfit). Recognizable to Gen Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "11. **“Gossip Girl” Character** – Preppy outfits, designer vibes, optional headpiece.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you want, I can make a **shortlist of 5 costumes that are the *perfect mix* of trendy, recognizable, and super low-effort**—including exactly what you’d need to buy or already have at home. That way you can literally throw it together in under an hour.\n",

    "If you want, I can **also make a “cheat sheet” version** with **exact stores, colors, and affordable items you could grab online or in your closet**, so you could literally assemble one in under 30 minutes. That would make it 100% no-brainer.\n",

    "# Takeaways and Conclusion\n",
    "ChatGPT’s response was organized and easy to follow. It split ideas into categories like Pop Culture/TV & Movies, Music/Pop Stars, Internet/Meme Culture, and Simple/Low-Effort. The structure made it easier to process, though it also made the suggestions feel formulaic. Most of the options were popular and recognizable — like Wednesday Addams or Barbie — showing that the AI relies heavily on what’s trending rather than offering anything especially original.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AI did take practicality into account, often suggesting easy costumes that didn’t require much effort. For instance, the Euphoria-inspired look depended mostly on makeup, which was convenient but also somewhat predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "When ChatGPT offered to make a shortlist of five “perfect mix” options, I agreed. Its follow-up included more details on what each costume would need, but the guidance sometimes felt overly specific. Later, I turned down its offer to make a full “cheat sheet” of stores and items, since I didn’t want it to dictate every part of the process. That decision underscored how easy it is to let the AI take over creative control if you’re not careful.\n",
