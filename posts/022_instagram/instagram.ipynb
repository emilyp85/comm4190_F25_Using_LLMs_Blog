    "# Introduction\n",
    "As you might know, Halloweekend just ended. That means that Instagram will be flooded with posts from college students in their costumes taken in their natural habitat: parties. I am one of them. Because I like my feed to be have a certain aesthetic and vibe to all my photos, I decided to recruit ChatGPT for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt I asked ChatGPT was: *\"what songs should i post my post about halloween party to on instagram?\"* I believe this is a pretty fair question to ask as ChatGPT has access to numerous posts from Instagram and can analyze the general trend and know what I am looking for.\n",

    "Would you like me to tailor the list to a **specific vibe** — like hot-girl Halloween, chill party recap, or cinematic edit energy? That’ll help narrow it down to the top 3–5 perfect songs for your post.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Takeaways\n",
    "Unfortunately, none of the songs ChatGPT provided made the cut for me. All these songs are pretty basic and does not fit neither the aesthetic nor the vibe of what I am looking for. All these songs or either a little too trendy or isn't \"Halloweekend\" enough for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "While ChatGPT’s recommendations were thoughtful and organized by vibe, they ultimately felt too predictable. The lists leaned on mainstream pop and overused TikTok sounds that didn’t quite capture the energy I wanted for my Halloween post — something more moody, camp, and distinctly Halloweekend-coded.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this experiment showed me, though, is that while AI can categorize aesthetics and trends well, it still struggles with nuance — especially when it comes to personal taste and the subtle cultural cues behind social media “vibes.” It can recognize patterns, but it can’t fully sense the irony, chaos, or micro-aesthetic that people curate during something as specific as Halloweekend.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, I realized that part of the fun of posting is choosing the song yourself — the one that feels just right in that moment, even if it’s niche, old, or completely unexpected. Sometimes, aesthetic intuition can’t be algorithmically generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I decided to post the photos without a music attached to them."
