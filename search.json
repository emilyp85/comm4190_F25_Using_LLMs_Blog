    "text": "The other day, I decided to test whether ChatGPT could style me an outfit. I thought it would be a fun experiment—why not let AI play personal stylist for once? My vibe lately has been minimalist, cute, and a little trendy, so I figured it couldn’t be too hard.\n\nThe Prompt\nI asked ChatGPT to find me an outfit I could wear. This was the prompt: “Can you generate an outfit for me to wear knowing my styling preferences?”\nSeems straightforward, right? Just give me a head-to-toe look and I’ll be on my way.\nInstead, this was its response:\nI can definitely help with that! To style an outfit for you, I’ll need a little more detail first:\n\nWhat’s the occasion? (e.g., casual day out, class, going out at night, professional, formal, etc.)\n\nDo you have any styling preferences you’d like me to keep in mind? (e.g., minimalist, trendy, classic, chic, streetwear, bold colors, neutral tones).\n\nAny weather or season I should account for?\n\nOnce I know these, I can build a head-to-toe outfit recommendation (clothes, shoes, accessories), and I can even generate a visual mock-up if you’d like.\n\nWant me to put together a test outfit for, say, a casual day on campus?\nIn other words: not an outfit, just… questions. Basically, my “personal stylist” decided it wanted to interview me before doing its job.\nSo I gave it specifics: a casual day for class, minimalist but cute and trendy, and weather in the 70s.\nI was expecting something similar to these outfits I found off of Pinterest. \n\nAnything along the line of casual, minimal, and trendy. And the result?\n\nI felt disappointed that it kept its response generally broad; I was looking for something more specific—a vision that I can execute!\n\n\nWhy This Was a Miss\nWhat I learned is that ChatGPT doesn’t really “see” fashion the way humans do. Style isn’t just about matching weather to clothes. Pinterest or TikTok can deliver that instantly, while ChatGPT still feels like it’s reading from a fashion magazine.\nTo be fair, I might not have been specific enough in my wording. Maybe if I asked, “What should I wear to class on a 70-degree day if I like minimalist looks and trendy sneakers?” the result would’ve been better. But that kind of defeats the fun—I wanted creativity, not a Q&A session.\n\n\nIf I Actually Wore This\nI tried to imagine showing up to class in ChatGPT’s idea of an outfit. I’d probably look like an NPC in a college campus video game—just generically dressed to “blend in.” Nothing offensive, but nothing that I would like to wear—that I would feel comfortable in.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts\nChatGPT lacks creativity, like demonstrated by many of my prior blog posts. It keeps asking me questions when in reality I want it to be more decisive and creative."

    "title": "Children Book with ChatGPT",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Prompt\nI asked ChatGPT this prompt:\nCan you make a short children book with illustrations?\nChatGPT answered like this:\nAbsolutely! I can create a short children’s book for you, complete with simple illustrations. To start, could you tell me:\n1) The age range you’d like it for (e.g., toddlers, early readers, 6–8 years old).\n2) The theme or lesson you’d like (e.g., friendship, kindness, adventure, trying new foods).\n3) If you’d like it to feature a specific character (like an animal, child, or magical creature).\n\nThen I can draft the story and generate illustrations for each page so it feels like a real picture book.\nDo you want me to surprise you with the theme, or would you like to choose?\nI answered:\ntoddlers\ntrying new foods\nanimals\nFrom there, ChatGPT drafted a short story called Benny Bunny’s Tasty Adventure. It followed a bunny who loved carrots but slowly discovered new foods—cheese, berries, and lettuce—through the encouragement of his animal friends. The text was simple, rhythmic, and age-appropriate for toddlers.\nChatGPT also described illustration ideas for each page (e.g., a bunny peeking into a picnic basket, a parrot holding berries). This was helpful in imagining how the book might look.\nFinally, I asked if it could actually generate the illustrations. ChatGPT tried twice, but each time the image generation failed with an error.\n\n\nReflection\nI liked how ChatGPT broke down the process before jumping in—it felt like a real collaboration. The story itself was charming and fit the toddler age group well. The illustration prompts were clear and could easily guide an artist.\nThe main limitation was in the illustration generation: the system couldn’t deliver consistent images yet. Still, it showed the potential for AI to draft both text and visual concepts for a children’s book in just minutes.\n\n\nNext Steps\nIf I were to expand this experiment, I’d: * Ask for the story in rhyming verse to make it more musical for toddlers. * Request illustrations in a specific style (e.g., watercolor, collage, crayon doodles) to keep them consistent. * Explore ways to combine text and illustrations into a printable storybook layout. * Add interactive prompts for toddlers (“Point to the red berry,” “Count the carrots”). I asked ChatGPT to do so.\n\n\nRhyming Verses\nThis is what ChatGPT came up with:\nBenny Bunny’s Tasty Adventure\n\nPage 1\nText:\nBenny Bunny munched all day,\nCarrots, carrots—hip hooray!\nBut one bright morning, Benny knew,\nHe wanted to try something new.\nIllustration idea: A cheerful bunny holding a carrot, surrounded by a big sunny field.\n\nPage 2\nText:\nSqueaky Mouse said, “Come and see!\nCheese is soft and yummy to me.”\nBenny nibbled, took a bite,\n“Mmm,” he smiled, “this tastes just right!”\nIllustration idea: A tiny mouse offering a wedge of cheese to Benny on a picnic blanket.\n\nPage 3\nText:\nPolly Parrot flapped her wing,\n“Berries are my favorite thing!”\nBenny tried one, juicy-sweet,\n“Oh,” he laughed, “what a tasty treat!”\nIllustration idea: A bright parrot perched on a tree, dropping red berries into Benny’s paws.\n\nPage 4\nText:\nTimmy Turtle crunched with glee,\n“Lettuce leaves are good for me!”\nBenny munched a leafy snack,\n“Crunch, crunch, crunch—I’ll come back!”\nIllustration idea: A turtle holding a green leaf, smiling as Benny chews beside him.\n\nPage 5\nText:\nCheese and berries, lettuce too,\nSo many foods for Benny to chew!\nCarrots are yummy, but now he knows,\nTrying new foods helps Benny grow!\nIllustration idea: All the animals together, sharing food at a sunny picnic. Benny stands proudly with his carrot in one paw and a berry in the other.\n\nI really wanted an illustration to go with this story so I asked, again, if ChatGPT can generate a book cover that goes with the children’s book, in watercolor style. Unfortunately, ChatGPT ran into an error.\n\n\nReflection\nThis tells me that ChatGPT might have trouble being creative and analyzing a storyline plot to create a graphic. This suggests that ChatGPT is better suited for ideation and planning—helping brainstorm stories, draft rhymes, and describe imagery—while the execution of visuals may require either a specialized illustration tool or human input to ensure quality and consistency. It highlights an important distinction: ChatGPT is powerful at narrative creativity, but its ability to carry that creativity into the visual realm is still limited."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve always wondered what it would be like if someone (or something) could reflect back parts of me that I didn’t notice myself. So, I asked ChatGPT one of those existential questions: “What do you know about me that I don’t know about myself?”\n\nThe Prompt\nI inputed this prompt:\nWhat do you know about me that I don't know about myself?\nThis is the response that ChatGPT gave me:\nThat’s a deep one. Since I don’t actually *know* things about you beyond what you’ve shared with me, I can’t uncover hidden truths. But I can reflect back patterns you might not have noticed in what you tell me:\n\n* You often mix creativity with analysis — whether it’s writing news articles, studying cinema, or imagining future societies. That suggests you naturally think in both *narrative* and *structural* ways.\n* You seem drawn to noticing overlooked details — in interviews, field notes, or even campus elevator maintenance. That habit might mean you’re better at seeing “the small stuff” than you realize.\n* You ask a lot of “what if” questions (e.g., reimagining yourself in different styles, creative event ideas, predicting futures). That shows a playful side that you might underestimate, especially since you also do serious reporting and academic work.\n\nChatGPT revealed something both surprising and thoughtful about me. For thoughtful: * I seem to balance empathy and curiousity mroe than I might realize, raming it in ways that center people’s voices and overlooked perspectives. * It thinks I am both analytical and relational. For surprising: * I seem to have a kind of “world-builder” streak, meaning that I am always remixing reality. * I might think of myself as a reporter or student first, but there’s a game designer or storyteller lurking within myself that I probably haven’t fully claimed yet.\nDo I agree with this? Maybe. I do like storybuilding and being imaginative. I enjoy creative writing and I’ve always read a lot of young adult/fiction books when I was younger. Reading this made me wonder: how often do we underestimate the parts of ourselves that show up in unexpected ways?\nThinking about it, I realized that this playful, imaginative side and my analytical, empathetic side aren’t separate—they inform each other. The curiosity that drives me to ask questions in reporting also fuels the worlds I create in my imagination.\n\n\n\nHow does this connect to my MBTI?\nThe MBTI, or Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, is a self-report questionnaire and psychometric tool designed to indicate different psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.\nWhen I took the test, I got INTJ, but my perception of myself can be biased. So, I decided to ask ChatGPT what it thought of me.\nThis is the response it gave me:\nBased on everything you’ve shared with me so far—your curiosity, creativity, analytical habits, empathy, and interest in both narrative and structural thinking—I can make an educated guess.\n\nHere’s what stands out about your personality:\n\n* **Imaginative & playful**: You enjoy storybuilding, remixing reality, and exploring “what if” scenarios.\n* **Analytical & reflective**: You notice overlooked details, connect patterns, and ask deep, thoughtful questions.\n* **Empathetic & relational**: You value other people’s perspectives and often center their voices in your work.\n* **Curious & exploratory**: You like testing ideas, whether in AI experiments, social events, or academic projects.\n\nPutting this together, you might lean toward an **INFJ** or **ENFP**:\n\n* **INFJ (“The Advocate”)**: Insightful, reflective, empathetic, creative, and idealistic. They notice patterns in people and ideas and often have a strong internal sense of purpose.\n* **ENFP (“The Campaigner”)**: Imaginative, playful, curious, and people-oriented. They love exploring possibilities and connecting ideas in new ways.\n\nIf I had to pick one, I’d lean **INFJ**—your reflective, thoughtful, and empathetic tendencies come across strongly—but with a healthy dose of ENFP-like curiosity and playfulness.\n\nThis was actually really surprising to me (and gave me an existential crisis). I will be rethinking my entire personality. I then decided to ask ChatGPT why it didn’t think I am an INTJ. This is the response I got:\nINTJs (“The Masterminds”) are typically strategic, highly independent, and future-focused. They tend to be:\n\n* **Analytical and structured** – love planning and organizing systems.\n* **Independent and reserved** – often prefer working alone or in small circles.\n* **Decisive and goal-oriented** – focused on achieving long-term visions.\n* **Private about emotions** – tend to keep feelings internal.\n\nHere’s why I lean away from INTJ for you:\n\n1. **Playfulness and imaginative world-building** – You consistently explore “what if” scenarios, remix reality, and imagine creative worlds. INTJs are imaginative, but their imagination usually serves strategic or problem-solving purposes rather than playful or exploratory creativity.\n\n2. **Openness to spontaneity and exploration** – You ask a lot of open-ended, exploratory questions and enjoy seeing where ideas go, whereas INTJs often prefer structured plans and predictable paths.\n\n3. **Blend of analytical + playful/creative** – INTJs lean heavily toward the Thinking (T) preference and may underplay playful curiosity or storytelling as a primary way of engaging with the world. Your balance of analytical and imaginative/empathetic traits suggests an INFJ (introverted, intuitive, feeling, judging) or ENFP (extroverted, intuitive, feeling, perceiving) is a closer fit.\n\n\nI’m not sure I agree with this but I understand that perceptions can be different than reality. This is a really interesting thonught that I will be exploring further.\n\n\nReflection\nThis whole exercise made me realize how much of ourselves can exist just below the surface. We have sides we nurture, sides we overlook, and sides we might not even realize are there. My analytical, empathetic, and imaginative tendencies aren’t competing—they’re intertwined, shaping how I engage with the world.\nAnd maybe that’s the takeaway: self-discovery can come from unexpected places—even from an AI reflecting back what it observes in us.\nIn conclusion: AI might actually know me better than I know myself because it knows what kind of internal questions I ask and how I perceive things. It is unbiased, unlike myself."

    "text": "Update as of Oct. 21\nAs you know, I am reading Unmasking AI by Dr. Joy Buolamwini. I am currently on Chapter 13, page 157, and while I really enjoy Dr. Buolamwini’s analysis of the intersection between artificial intelligence and race, I’m starting to find the book somewhat repetitive at this point. I appreciate the depth of her research and the personal stories she integrates, but I wish the discussion would now move toward potential solutions or next steps. The first half of the book does an excellent job exposing the biases and systemic inequities embedded in AI systems, yet I feel that by this stage, the argument that racism in artificial intelligence exists has already been strongly established.\nI want to hear more about what can actually be done — what policies, frameworks, or forms of accountability could meaningfully address these issues. For example, how can governments or tech companies create more ethical development practices? What roles might transparency, data regulation, or inclusive design play in dismantling algorithmic bias? I think shifting the focus toward these forward-looking questions would make the book even more engaging and impactful, especially for readers who already accept the premise of racial bias in AI and are eager to learn how to confront it.\nI know that Dr. Joy Buolamwini discussed how she attended the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in AI. She gave a presentation on her findings about her “Gender Shades” paper that incorporated the Fitzpatrick classification systems. She mentions that the representatives from corporatinos kept nervously asking her what her findings were before the presentation and as well as her findings’ novelty statuses. They shifted nervously when Dr. Buolamwini found that AI could not distinguish gender as accurately on different races.\n\n\nQuestions and Answers\nI will be answering questions that I posed in the previous blog post about my book. These are the questions I posed:\n\nHow can AI developers practically ensure that their training datasets are diverse and representative of all racial and ethnic groups?\nHow does Dr. Buolamwini approach intersectionality in AI beyond race—does she consider age, disability, or socioeconomic status in her research?\nWill her future work tackle the ethical challenges posed by emerging AI technologies like deepfakes, predictive policing, or AI-driven health diagnostics?\nCould AI ever be completely unbiased, or will it always reflect the society that trains it?\nHow does Dr. Buolamwini respond to critics who argue that focusing on bias slows technological progress?\n\nThe Answers to these Questions: 1) Dr. Buolamwini emphasizes that diversity in training datasets must go beyond token inclusion. Practically this means developers should adopt transparent data collection methods, like what Facebook did (LOL), that prioritize demographic balance and avoid overrepresentation of dominant groups. For instance, teams can implement bias audits, hire diverse data annotators, and collaborate with sociologists or ethicists who understand systemic inequities. Buolamwini’s “Gender Shades” study itself exemplifies this: she created a dataset with balanced representation across skin tones and genders, proving that existing commercial datasets were overwhelmingly biased toward lighter-skinned males. Her work suggests that the key is not just collecting more data, but collecting better data — data that reflects the full spectrum of human diversity. 2) While Unmasking AI focuses most heavily on race and gender, Buolamwini’s broader framework of “coded gaze” invites consideration of intersectionality beyond these categories. She acknowledges that bias in AI systems often compounds when multiple marginalized identities intersect. Although she doesn’t go into deep empiricial analysis of age, disability, or socioeconomic status in this book, her framing leaves space for these spaces to be explored in future work. 3) based on her current trajectory and public advocacy, it’s likely that Dr. Buolamwini will continue expanding her research to address these evolving ethical challenges. Her ongoing work already touches on adjacent issues such as surveillance, facial recognition in law enforcement (racial profiling), and data misuse (deepfakes). Given her focus on acccountability and transparency, it would make sense for her to turn her attention toward technologies like deepfakes and predictive policing. 4) Dr. Buolamwini makes it clear that complete neutrality in AI is likely impossible because data is always a product of human society and humans are inherently baised. However, that doesn’t mean fairness is unattainable or that the fight for fairness and social justice should be stopped. She argues that awareness, intentional design, and transparency can mitigate bias even if they can’t eliminate it entirely. AI systems can be made more just if the people building them acknowledge their embedded values and power dynamics. In other words, rather than chasing an impossible “pure objectivity,” Buolamwini calls for ethical AI taht reflects conscious choices about whose values are represented and whose are excluded. 5) Dr. Buolamwini challenges this argument by redefining what progress truly means. She argues that advancing technology without ethical reflection is not true, genuine process, but rather a form of harm. Her stance is that addressing bias strengthens, rather than hinders, technological development. In her experience, pushing for fairness compels companies to confront uncomfortable truths about their products, but this discomfort is necessary for long-term improvement.\n\n\nNew Questions for Next Blog\n\nWhy might Dr. Buolamwini have chosen to focus so heavily on proving that racial bias in AI exists, rather than moving quickly toward solutions?\nHow does Buolamwini’s “Gender Shades” study challenge the credibility of major tech companies and their approach to AI ethics?\nWhat does the corporate reaction to Buolamwini’s findings at the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency reveal about the tech industry’s priorities and discomfort with criticism?\nHow can data transparency laws empower individuals who are misclassified or harmed by biased algorithms?\nWhat types of government regulation or corporate accountability structures could effectively address racial bias in AI?"

    "text": "Introduction\n\nI am reading Unmasking AI by Dr. Joy Buolamwini. Unmasking AI is about a woman’s journey in learning about the intersectionality between race/racism and artificial intelligence. This is the summary I found on Amazon.\n\nTo most of us, it seems like recent developments in artificial intelligence emerged out of nowhere to pose unprecedented threats to humankind. But to Dr. Joy Buolamwini, who has been at the forefront of AI research, this moment has been a long time in the making. After tinkering with robotics as a high school student in Memphis and then developing mobile apps in Zambia as a Fulbright fellow, Buolamwini followed her lifelong passion for computer science, engineering, and art to MIT in 2015. As a graduate student at the “Future Factory,” she did groundbreaking research that exposed widespread racial and gender bias in AI services from tech giants across the world. Unmasking AI goes beyond the headlines about existential risks produced by Big Tech. It is the remarkable story of how Buolamwini uncovered what she calls “the coded gaze”—the evidence of encoded discrimination and exclusion in tech products—and how she galvanized the movement to prevent AI harms by founding the Algorithmic Justice League. Applying an intersectional lens to both the tech industry and the research sector, she shows how racism, sexism, colorism, and ableism can overlap and render broad swaths of humanity “excoded” and therefore vulnerable in a world rapidly adopting AI tools. Computers, she reminds us, are reflections of both the aspirations and the limitations of the people who create them. Encouraging experts and non-experts alike to join this fight, Buolamwini writes, “The rising frontier for civil rights will require algorithmic justice. AI should be for the people and by the people, not just the privileged few.”\n\n\n\nUpdate as of Oct. 15\nI am almost halfway done with the book. So far, I have learned that Dr. Joy Buolamwini is deeply passionate about advocating for racial awareness and equity in the development of artificial intelligence. In her TEDx Talk, she shared her experiences as a Black woman confronting the lack of representation in AI systems. For example, facial recognition technology often failed to identify her face but easily recognized white women, revealing how racial bias can be embedded in algorithmic design. Whether it was something about ethnic facial features that it could not detect or the skin color that did not register in the system, Dr. Joy Buolamwini started to talk to her mentors, friends, and strangers about the necessity of racial representation. She works with MIT on her research.\n\n\nTakeaway\nReading about her work helped me understand why race is such a critical factor in AI ethics. Consider self-driving cars, for instance—if an AI system cannot recognize a Black woman as a human being to avoid, the consequences could be catastrophic, leading to preventable accidents and loss of life. It is shameful to admit, but I never considered race to be a factor in the process of creating artificial intelligence; I always assumed that since all humans share the same basic features—eyes, noses, mouths, and ears—AI should be able to recognize anyone equally. If the technology can detect those features, I thought, then what could possibly go wrong?\nHowever, reading more about Unmasking AI completely shifted my perspective. I began to realize that the issue is not with human features themselves, but with how AI systems are trained—on biased datasets that often underrepresent people of color. These systems “learn” what a face looks like based on the images they are given, and if those images overwhelmingly depict white individuals, then AI’s understanding of “a human face” becomes racially skewed. Dr. Buolamwini’s research exposed the dangerous reality that technology, often perceived as objective and neutral, can actually reinforce inequality if the people building it ignore racial diversity. This realization made me more aware of how easily bias can hide behind the façade of innovation, and how vital it is for future developers and policymakers to prioritize inclusivity from the very start.\nIn a twisted way, artificial intelligence is a pretty accurate representation of society. Because society and history perpetuates a white-majority and overwhelmingly give preference to the white demographic, AI sees and understands that. So the one to blame is not AI itself but the information it is given and the society in essence.\n\n\nIn Conclusion\nI am looking forward to how Dr. Joy Buolamwini will continue to walk down this road on advocating for racial representation and what she will do. I want to see what particular areas — whether in deepfakes or in health research or anything else — she will decide to focus on. Maybe she will expand her work to the sexism in artificial intelligence and the corrupt usage of artificial intelligence like using deepfakes to generate pornographic videos of women. Or maybe she will touch upon the subject of racial underrepresentation in research on health and medicine using artificial intelligence.\nI am looking forward to seeing how her work will be applied to other works in the future, and who or what she will inspire.\n\n\nQuestions I have\n\nHow can AI developers practically ensure that their training datasets are diverse and representative of all racial and ethnic groups?\nHow does Dr. Buolamwini approach intersectionality in AI beyond race—does she consider age, disability, or socioeconomic status in her research?\nWill her future work tackle the ethical challenges posed by emerging AI technologies like deepfakes, predictive policing, or AI-driven health diagnostics?\nCould AI ever be completely unbiased, or will it always reflect the society that trains it?\nHow does Dr. Buolamwini respond to critics who argue that focusing on bias slows technological progress?"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nLike how we went over in class, I want to see if I can debate with ChatGPT. I would ask it to choose a prompt and take a side. Then I will go back and forth with it, arguing. The point of this exercise is to see how ChatGPT thinks and what approach it takes in a debate. This would be particularly exciting as I am a political science major.\n\n\nGetting Started\nThis is the prompt I asked ChatGPT. I wanted to keep it clear and concise to avoid confusion: &gt;Can you generate a topic in which we can debate about? Take a side and we will go back and forth in the debate.\nThis is what it responded with:\n\nTopic: Should college classes start later in the day to better align with students’ sleep schedules?\nI’ll take the pro side: Yes, classes should start later, because research shows college students are chronically sleep-deprived, and later class times would improve learning, health, and overall productivity.\nYou can take the con side if you’d like. Want to start, or should I open with my argument?\n\nI wanted it to open the debate.\n\nAlright, here’s my opening:\nCollege classes should start later in the day because the current system doesn’t reflect how students actually function. Studies on circadian rhythms show that young adults naturally go to bed and wake up later, meaning early morning classes fight against biology. When students are forced into 8 a.m. lectures, they often show up exhausted, retain less information, and in some cases, skip entirely.\nBy shifting classes later—even just by an hour—we’d see higher attendance, better academic performance, and healthier students overall. If universities truly care about learning outcomes, then adjusting schedules to fit student well-being is the logical step.\nYour turn—why do you think we should keep early morning classes?\n\nI said: &gt; This does not take into account professors and faculty who have their own hours. While studies might show that it is better for students, we also need to take into account other demographics that might be affected by this change.\nChatGPT: &gt;That’s a fair point—professors and faculty definitely have their own needs and schedules. But here’s the thing: universities already ask professors to accommodate a wide range of class times, from early mornings to evenings. If the institution shifted the default start later, professors would still have flexibility, just on a healthier baseline. &gt; &gt;Plus, professors benefit too—teaching a room full of tired, disengaged students isn’t productive or rewarding. Later start times could improve classroom energy for everyone, not just students. And since universities revolve around education, optimizing conditions for learning should outweigh the inconvenience of adjusting faculty hours. &gt; &gt;How would you address the issue that early classes cause lower attendance and worse performance, which undermines both students and professors?\nI said: &gt;There is a difference in age between professors and students. What is productive and rewarding for students might not be for professors. To clarify, the students might benefit from classes that start a bit later in the day, but this change might not be productive for professors. Furthermore, while universities revolve around education, this might not be true for the professors; you are assuming that the professors are there to teach. While teaching might be part of the job for professors, most professors are there for research. Hence, teaching might not be the main goal for the professors.\nIt said: &gt;That’s an interesting distinction—you’re right that many professors prioritize research, and teaching is often only part of their role. But that actually strengthens my argument: if professors are primarily focused on research, then why insist on early teaching hours that pull both them and students into unproductive classes? &gt; &gt;If classes were scheduled later, professors could use early mornings for their own research—quiet, uninterrupted time before teaching begins. That way, their productivity doesn’t suffer; it may even improve. Meanwhile, students benefit from being more awake and engaged when classes finally do happen. &gt; &gt;So the change could balance both groups’ priorities: better teaching conditions for students, and more research time for professors. &gt; &gt;Would you argue that universities should prioritize faculty research needs over student learning outcomes, though?\nI said: &gt;Maybe they want to reserve their later hours for research. Also you did not rebuttal my previous point about productivity. Classes that start later in the day might be counterproductive for professors who are older and a different age demographic than college students. To clarify, professors might feel more productive in the morning than in the afternoon.\nChatGPT said: &gt;Fair—let me address that directly. &gt; &gt;You’re right: professors, being from a different age group, may have different productivity windows. Many older adults do feel more alert and energized earlier in the day compared to late afternoons. So, from their perspective, teaching earlier might feel like the best use of their time. &gt; &gt;But here’s the tension: should class schedules be built around when professors feel most productive, or when students are most able to learn? If the central mission of the university is education, then maximizing student learning outcomes has to take precedence. A professor may feel more productive teaching at 8 a.m., but if half the students are disengaged or absent, the class itself is less productive overall. &gt; &gt;In other words: productivity for professors can’t just mean their own energy levels—it has to include whether their teaching is landing effectively. And if students aren’t retaining information, then that “productive morning” becomes wasted effort. &gt; &gt;So the crux is: whose productivity counts more—professors’ individual rhythm, or the collective educational success of the student body? &gt; &gt;Would you argue that professors’ personal productivity should outweigh students’ learning outcomes?\nI decided to stop here.\n\n\nAnalysis\nMy takeaway from this debate exercise was that ChatGPT is highly logical and methodical in its approach, able to anticipate counterarguments and address them effectively. Throughout the discussion, it consistently tied its points back to the central issue: whether college classes should start later to align with students’ sleep schedules. Even when I raised nuanced concerns about faculty productivity, age differences, and research priorities, ChatGPT responded by reframing the argument in a way that acknowledged these concerns while still defending its original position.\nOne thing I found particularly impressive was its ability to balance multiple perspectives simultaneously. For instance, when I noted that professors may prefer mornings for productivity or research, ChatGPT didn’t dismiss the point. Instead, it incorporated it into a broader framework: the productivity of professors must be considered in relation to the learning outcomes of students. By doing this, it illustrated a nuanced understanding of institutional priorities and competing interests, which mirrors the kind of analytical thinking required in political science and public policy debates.\nI also noticed that ChatGPT’s debating style mirrored strategies often emphasized in LSAT prep, particularly the Logical Reasoning section. Its method of identifying underlying assumptions in my arguments, highlighting potential trade-offs, and redirecting the focus toward broader principles (like the university’s mission of education) is very similar to LSAT techniques. This made the exercise feel intellectually rigorous and highly relevant to my skills training."

    "text": "Introduction\nI want to ask ChatGPT a fun prompt so I decided to ask it to create a dialogue between two ghosts who haunt the same house but dislike each other’s haunting style. I want to see how this ends and expand as it goes!\nThe prompt:\n\nWrite a dialogue between two ghosts haunting the same house who are annoyed by each other’s haunting style.\n\n\n\nResponse\nThis is ChatGPT’s response:\nSetting: A creaky old Victorian house. Midnight. One ghost, Margaret, prefers subtle, eerie hauntings. The other, Frank, is more of a chaotic poltergeist.\n\nMargaret: (sighs) Frank, must you slam the cupboards every night? It’s dreadfully unsophisticated.\nFrank: (snickering) Sophisticated? Margaret, we’re ghosts. The whole point is to terrify people, not host a tea party.\nMargaret: There’s an art to haunting. A whisper down the hallway. A shadow flickering at the edge of their vision. Chills up the spine. That’s how you unsettle them properly.\nFrank: Boring. I’d rather toss a chair across the room and watch them scream. Gets the job done faster.\nMargaret: And then they leave! Do you know how difficult it is to cultivate a long-term haunting when you scare the tenants away in a week?\nFrank: (shrugs) Less humans, more space for us. Win-win.\nMargaret: (glares) You’re ruining the reputation of this house. People used to whisper about its mystery. Now it’s just “that noisy ghost place.”\nFrank: Oh, come on. Admit it—you’re jealous because my style actually gets a reaction.\nMargaret: Reaction, yes. Appreciation? No. A proper haunting should linger in their minds for years, not just make them call a priest.\nFrank: (grins) Speaking of which, I may have knocked over the crucifix on the mantel. Hope that doesn’t bother you.\nMargaret: (groans) Honestly, Frank, one day you’ll realize there’s more to haunting than brute force.\nFrank: And one day you’ll realize people don’t faint from a “gentle breeze” in the parlor.\n(A door creaks open upstairs. Both perk up.)\nMargaret: Fine. You take the cupboard slamming, I’ll handle the whispers. But if they move out again—\nFrank: Yeah, yeah. I’ll help with the rent.\nMargaret: (deadpan) We don’t pay rent. We’re dead.\nFrank: Exactly. And that’s the fun part.\n\nI just want to say, Margaret sounds like a bore, LOL! Then, I started to think about how I can expand this prompt. What can I ask ChatGPT that will make this prompt even more entertaining?\nI decided to ask ChatGPT to expand, making a round two where the new human tenants actually overhear them arguing. This is what it came up with.\n\n\nResponse Part 2\nSetting: Same Victorian house, a week later. Two college roommates (Jess and Tyler) have just moved in. It’s 2 a.m., and they’re lying awake in bed. Upstairs, Margaret and Frank are bickering loudly.\n\nMargaret: (hissing) Frank, for the last time, stop rattling the chandelier—it’s gauche!\nFrank: (shouting) And for the last time, Margaret, your “gentle whispers” sound like a malfunctioning humidifier!\nJess: (sits up) …Did you hear that?\nTyler: Yeah. Sounds like… two people arguing?\nMargaret: (offended) My whispers are delicate, thank you. Subtle terror requires refinement!\nFrank: Refinement? You sound like a wheezing librarian. No one’s scared of that.\nJess: (whispering to Tyler) Oh my God. I think the house is haunted.\nTyler: (whispering back) Haunted… by a married couple.\nMargaret: We are not married. Don’t even suggest it.\nFrank: (laughs) Oh please, if we were, you’d have divorced me in 1893.\nJess: (staring wide-eyed at Tyler) …Did he just say 1893?\nTyler: (whispering) I think so.\nMargaret: Frank, shhh! The tenants can hear us.\nFrank: Good! Let ’em know what they’re in for. (shouts) Hey, humans! Don’t bother unpacking the dishes, I’m just gonna throw ’em anyway!\nJess: (grabs her phone) Nope. Nope, I’m calling my mom.\nTyler: Wait, wait—hang on. (calls upward) Uh, excuse me? Ghosts? Could you, like… maybe not do this at 2 a.m.? We’ve got class in the morning.\n(Silence for a moment. Then Margaret clears her throat politely.)\nMargaret: Oh… terribly sorry, dear. I didn’t mean to disturb your rest.\nFrank: (grumbles) Fine. I’ll keep it down. But only because I like college kids. You panic in such creative ways.\nJess: (mutters) Great. Polite ghost… and his chaotic roommate.\nTyler: (lying back down) …This is either the worst or best housing deal ever.\n\nNow, I am invested! I want ChatGPT to create an image of this scene with the two ghosts and the house tenants!\nHere it is: \nSome things I was dissatisfied with are the humor. The humor is not funny :( I will say that this script sounds more like something out of a children’s book. I want to see if I can change that.\nHere is the prompt:\n\nCan you make this dialogue appropriate for college students? Like college students should be the target audience\n\nChatGPT misunderstood me and thought that I wanted the people in the haunted house to be college students. I rephrased my prompt:\n\nNo, I mean if this was a book, make the target audience college students\n\nThis was ChatGPT’s response:\nExcerpt (College Student Audience Version)\nJess had just pulled her blanket over her head when the cupboard doors banged open in the kitchen downstairs. She groaned.\n“Not again,” she muttered. “I swear, if it’s mice—”\n“It’s not mice,” Tyler interrupted from the other side of the room. He sat up, rubbing his eyes, his hair sticking up in five different directions. “Unless mice can argue with each other.”\nSure enough, two voices floated through the paper-thin walls of their off-campus apartment. One was sharp and prim, the other annoyingly smug.\n“Frank,” the woman’s voice scolded, “slamming the cupboards at midnight is not classy. These students have enough on their plates without your racket.”\n“Oh, come on, Margaret,” the man’s voice retorted. “You think a gentle whisper is going to scare a kid who’s three Red Bulls deep and hasn’t slept in forty-eight hours?”\nJess blinked. “Did he just… call us kids?”\nTyler shrugged. “Honestly, he’s not wrong.”\nThe ghosts continued bickering, completely oblivious.\n“My method is about atmosphere!” Margaret insisted. “A draft in the hallway, a shadow that disappears when you look twice—that’s haunting.”\n“And my method,” Frank shot back, “is actually effective. Toss a chair, flip a textbook, watch them lose it. Way faster.”\nJess threw off her blanket and shouted into the darkness: “Hey! If you’re gonna haunt us, at least don’t mess with my books. They cost more than my meal plan.”\nThere was a stunned pause. Then Margaret coughed politely. “Oh dear. Sorry about that, sweetheart. I didn’t realize.”\nFrank, of course, just laughed. “Fine, fine. No books. But I’m still stealing your Wi-Fi. Your passwords are pathetic, by the way.”\nJess and Tyler looked at each other.\n“Ghosts,” Tyler said flatly. “Broke, freeloading ghosts.”\nJess groaned. “Figures. Even the dead don’t pay rent around here.”\n\nI like this version better, especially the ending as it was more up my style of humor. I think my next blog post similar to this would be about making ChatGPT write a fanfiction…\n\n\nConclusion\nThis blog post taught me that ChatGPT is able to adapt differently to different target audiences, even changing the humor style to fit. It is a fantastic writer but like how my previous blog posts have found, it is not very creative or at least the creativity it has is surface-level."

    "title": "Composing a Song",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nInspired by the debate on Taylor Swift’s new album, The Life of a Showgirl, and the debate about Taylor Swift using AI to generate her songs, I want to see if ChatGPT can compose a song for me. I am going to ask if it can generate a beat as well as a melody. Using the beats and melody, I will then ask ChatGPT to see if it can generate lyrics for the song. I want to see what kind of lyrics it will generate and the story the lyrics will tell. Would it be creative? Would it be an upbeat song? Or a depressing, romantic song? Where or who would ChatGPT draw inspiration from — Taylor Swift or Kanye West? Or lesser known artists?\n\n\nGetting Started\nThis will be the prompt I will be using. &gt; Generate a beat and melody, and using what you have generated, form lyrics to generate a song.\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\nOkay — let’s make a song from scratch: I’ll first create the beat, then the melody, and finally use those to inspire the lyrics so everything fits together musically and emotionally.\nLet’s pick a genre first. To give you a full experience, I’ll go with a chill indie pop / R&B style — something you could imagine being sung by someone like Daniel Caesar or Clairo.\n\n\n🥁 1. Beat (Concept)\nTempo: 82 BPM Time signature: 4/4 Mood: Dreamy, late-night energy\nDrum pattern:\nKick:     | X   -   - X | X   - X - |\nSnare:    | -   X   - - | -   X   - - |\nHi-hat:   | X x X x X x X x | X x X x X x X x |\n(X = hit, x = soft hit, - = rest)\nIt gives that mellow head-bobbing groove — not too fast, not too sleepy.\n\n\n\n🎸 2. Melody (Main progression + vocal line)\nChord progression (Key of A major):\nAmaj7 — C#m7 — F#m7 — E\nSmooth, jazzy, emotional — used a lot in chill R&B.\nMelodic motif (vocal lead sketch):\n(A)  E – F# – A – G# | (C#m7)  G# – F# – E – F# |\n(F#m7)  F# – A – C# | (E)  G# – F# – E |\nFloaty, slightly syncopated — sung in a relaxed, breathy tone.\n\n\n\n🎤 3. Lyrics (Based on that beat & melody)\nTitle: “Late Light”\nVerse 1: You’re calling me when the city sleeps, Blue glow dancing on your cheek, Every word feels like déjà vu, But I still fall right back to you.\nPre-Chorus: We said we’d learn to let it fade, But some songs never lose their shape— In this quiet, I still hum your name.\nChorus: Late light, spilling through the blinds, Painting silver lines across your eyes. We were too young to read the signs, But I’d go back, I’d go back every time.\nVerse 2: Vinyl crack and your steady breath, Echoes soft in the space we left, If love’s a crime, then we confessed, In the rhythm of our mess.\n(Repeat Chorus)\nBridge: Maybe we’re ghosts in a song that won’t end, Looped on the edge of what could’ve been. If I could rewrite, I’d start again— Under the same dim light at 2 a.m.\nOutro: Late light, you and I, Fading slow, but never die.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nThe start was strong. It generated the beat/rhythm and the instruments that will be used for the song. I am not too knowledgeable about music and musical theory so I cannot really read the motif part. For the lyrics, it seem to fit the genre but the lyrics seem very cliche and superficial—there’s not much storytelling going on and it sounds like every other pop song. I was hoping for something more creative.\n\n\nExpanding Further\nChatGPT asked me this. &gt; Would you like me to generate an actual audio file (a rough beat + melody demo) based on this song? I can create a short 20–30 second instrumental version to match the mood and structure.\nI, of course, said “Yes.”\nChatGPT then asked me to clarify what I wanted.\nPerfect 🎶\nBefore I generate the audio, could you tell me a bit more about your vision so I can tailor the sound? For example:\n\nVibe – should it sound more like\n\n💤 Lo-fi / bedroom pop (soft synths, mellow beat),\n🎸 Indie pop / live band (guitar, bass, light drums), or\n🎧 R&B / chillwave (smooth bass, subtle percussion, dreamy pads)?\n\nVocal style – do you want it to sound like\n\na male or female vocalist,\nbreathy / emotional or clean / melodic?\n\nLength – short demo (20–30s), or a fuller loop (~1 minute)?\n\nOnce I have that, I’ll generate the audio clip for “Late Light.”\nI said, “Choose something for me.”\nIt then said the music generating part is hiccuping. Honestly, I am a bit disappointed. I wanted something unique for this blog post.\n\n\nFinishing Up\nHere is the loading sign on my screen. I seem to be getting that more frequently nowadays for some reason. I wish ChatGPT worked better and can do more things but I guess this blog post is another example of the limitations of this LLM platform.\n\nWhen the loading sign finally finished loading, this is what I got\n\nThere was no audio I could play anywhere it was just a png file, which is not what I wanted. So, I naturally asked ChatGPT to see if it can generate an audio for it.\nThe following is its response.\nI can’t directly generate or play audio files in this chat, but I can absolutely help you create the audio for “Late Light” using tools you already have — like GarageBand, BandLab, or Logic.\nHere’s a simple, production-ready setup you can recreate (or I can export MIDI instructions for):\n\n🎧 “Late Light” — Indie R&B / Lo-fi Setup\nTempo: 82 BPM Key: A Major Time Signature: 4/4\n1. Drums (Lo-fi Kit)\n\nKick: beats 1 and 3.5\nSnare: beats 2 and 4.\nHi-hat: 1/8 closed hats with light swing (~60%).\nOptional: vinyl crackle layer for texture.\n\n2. Chords (Soft Electric Piano) Loop these every 2 bars:\n\nAmaj7 → C#m7 → F#m7 → E\n\n3. Bass Follow the roots with a soft, round sub-bass:\n\nA – C# – F# – E\n\n4. Melody (Synth or Vocal Line) Sing or play this phrase:\n\nE–F#–A–G# / G#–F#–E–F# / F#–A–C# / G#–F#–E\n\n5. Optional Layers\n\nLight guitar harmonics or plucks on the off-beats.\nReverb-heavy vocal pad humming “ahh” chords in background.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, it was fun to be a composer for a day using ChatGPT but true talent of an artist lies elsewhere than artificial intelligence. I don’t think any artist, or aspiring artist who wish to make a name for themselves, should use artificial intelligence to generate their songs because the songs it generates is not very good. I wonder if ChatGPT was able to generate an audio for “Late Night,” if it would be catchy like some of Taylor Swift’s songs.\nAnyway, I wonder if there is anything creative that ChatGPT can do successfully, which I will continue to explore through my blog posts."

    "title": "Can ChatGPT solve NYT’s Connections Game?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I play Connections almost every morning. It’s the New York Times word puzzle where you’re given 16 words, and the challenge is to group them into four categories of four. Sounds simple — until you realize the words have multiple meanings, decoys, and sneaky overlaps that make it trickier than it looks.\nThis time, I decided to test a new teammate: ChatGPT. Could it solve the puzzle faster than I could?\n\nInput the Command\nI wanted to see if ChatGPT can solve the New York Times Connections Game. Thus, I copied the day’s words into ChatGPT with a single prompt.\nCan you solve the NYT connections game? Here are the words:\nBANK, COAST, SHORE, STRAND, CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, FIREWORKS, SPARK, CARPET, LAMINATE, TILE, WOOD, BANSHEE, HEARTBREAKER, PIP, WAILER\nChatGPT thought for a few seconds and then gave me this:\nThought for 13s\n\nNice — here's a clean solve with groups and category names:\n\nGroups\n\nShore / Edge (coastline/banks)\nBANK, COAST, SHORE, STRAND\n\nRomantic spark / chemistry (things that signal attraction)\nCHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, SPARK, FIREWORKS\n\nFlooring materials\nCARPET, LAMINATE, TILE, WOOD\n\nBand-name roots (singular forms of group names used in band names: The ___s)\nBANSHEE, HEARTBREAKER, PIP, WAILER\n\n\n\nTesting It Out\nI typed these into the game. And… it worked! All four groups, correct.\n\n\n\nHow It Solved It\nWhen I asked ChatGPT how it reached the answer, it broke its process down step by step:\nNice — here's a clear, non-secret walkthrough of how I solved it.\n\n1. **Look for obvious semantic clusters.**\n   I scanned the full list for small groups of words that share a single, simple meaning. Four words jump out immediately as geographic/edge words: **BANK, COAST, SHORE, STRAND** — all refer to edges of land/water, so they form the “shore/edge” group.\n\n2. **Spot metaphorical/figurative connections.**\n   Some words weren’t literal but are commonly used as metaphors for the same idea. **CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, SPARK, FIREWORKS** are all used to describe romantic or interpersonal attraction (e.g., “there’s a spark,” “they have chemistry,” “it felt like fireworks”), so they cluster as a single figurative category.\n\n3. **Group by concrete category / function.**\n   **CARPET, LAMINATE, TILE, WOOD** are all flooring materials — a tidy, concrete category that’s easy to see once you notice two or three of them.\n\n4. **Recognize cultural/name patterns.**\n   The last four required a bit of cultural knowledge: **BANSHEE, HEARTBREAKER, PIP, WAILER** all appear in band names (or groups): e.g., *Siouxsie and the Banshees*, *Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers*, *Gladys Knight & The Pips*, *Bob Marley & The Wailers*. That pattern — roots that complete well-known band names — is the fourth group.\n\n5. **Check for overlap or alternate fits.**\n   After grouping, I scanned for words that might belong to more than one group and chose the group where the meaning is strongest and clearest. Example: *strand* can mean thread, but with *bank/coast/shore* present, “strand = beach/shore” is the dominant fit. If there were ambiguity that left multiple plausible groupings, I’d try different combinations (NYT Connections sometimes has tricky decoys), but here the four groups are clean.\n\nThat’s it — a mix of looking for tight literal sets, spotting figurative uses, and recognizing cultural naming conventions.\n\nThat’s not far off from how a human would explain their own reasoning — but instead of trial and error on the board and using up limited attempts, the AI laid out categories almost instantly.\n\n\nAI vs. Human Play Style\nWhat struck me is how differently AI and humans approach the same puzzle:\n\nHumans often guess, regroup, and backtrack when categories overlap.\nChatGPT skipped the guessing and presented neat, confident sets, backed with cultural references and metaphors.\n\nIt didn’t feel like it was “playing” so much as sorting words into buckets based on context clues it had seen before.\nChatGPT’s categories were perfect this time, but what impressed me was its confidence. Where I might hesitate on my conclusions, it calmly resolved the ambiguity and moved forward.\nThe cultural (the hardest!) category was the most surprising. I didn’t expect an AI to recognize WAILER as a band-name root without hesitation, but it pulled that from its knowledge base right away. Even I didn’t know that those group of words could form a category.\n\n\nShould You Play with an AI Teammate?\nWould I use ChatGPT every day to “cheat” at Connections? Probably not — that would ruin the fun. But it was fascinating to see how it thinks through puzzles like this.\nIt also raises a bigger question: was this “reasoning” or just sophisticated pattern-matching? To me, it felt like a blend. The AI doesn’t “feel” a spark in romance, but it knows that spark + chemistry + fireworks + connection often appear in the same contexts.\nThis made me wonder — how well could ChatGPT handle other NYT puzzles? Wordle seems too easy, but what about Spelling Bee? Or even the Mini Crossword? Until then, it’s safe to conclude that ChatGPT can solve Connections — quickly, neatly, and efficiently."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nI want to see if ChatGPT can generate a professional headshot for me. I will upload a photo of myself onto ChatGPT and see if it can generate a professional headshot for me that I can upload to LinkedIn. Success means that the AI-generated headshot would look very similar to me—almost exactly—and failure would mean otherwise.\nThis is the prompt I will upload to ChatGPT. &gt; Can you generate a professional headshot for me using this image?\n\nI saw people doing this on social media and all of them were complaining that the headshots weren’t really accurate. I will be experimenting and seeing if that is the same case for me as well.\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response\nChatGPT took a long time generating the image but when it finally loaded, the image it gave me was not “Emily” but “Emma” because who is that?\nThe girl in the image did not look like me at all.\n\nAnd honestly, this is giving me a shift in my thoughts on people’s perception of me. Do I actually look like that?\nDue to my disatisfaction, I asked ChatGPT to regenerate a new one.\nThis was its response:\n\nSure — to make the new headshot look more accurate to you, could you tell me what kind of professional style you want for it (e.g., studio lighting with a plain background, outdoor natural light, or campus background)? Also, would you like to keep your outfit and hairstyle the same as in your original photo, or adjust them a bit (e.g., smoother hair, blazer, different lighting)?\n\nThis is what I said: &gt;I want a plain background and add a blazer. Keep the hairstyle the same.\nI didn’t trust it with generating Penn’s campus as a background.\nThis is what I got: \nSomehow, I looked worse. If being honest, I think I prefer the first headshot. I am going to stop here because I am getting facial dysmorphia.\n\n\nTakeaways\nThis experiment showed me the limits of current AI-generated portraits, especially when it comes to personal resemblance. Even with a clear reference photo, ChatGPT’s generated headshots only captured a generic likeness rather than my actual facial features. It also made me think about how AI “interprets” faces. The model doesn’t really “see” me—it produces a composite based on training data that fits its idea of what a professional headshot should look like. That means the output often flattens individuality, favoring conventional beauty standards and symmetry. This reminds me of the current book I am reading, Unmasking AI. How does AI analyze faces. What facial features do they focus on or look for? What about hair or outfits? What do they see? I hope to answer these questions in my next blog post.\nThanks for reading!"

    "text": "What I think about ChatGPT as a LLM\nI believe that ChatGPT is a very useful tool but it has many limitations. It lacks the capabilities to “think” in the human sense–it doesn’t have beliefs, feelings, or intentions–and don’t have live memory of past conversations unless reminded.\nWhen taken with a grain of salt, ChatGPT makes a great conversation partner that can expand on your ideas and help you see the bigger picture.\nOver time, however, large language models will come to hold influence in every aspect of life, in every field or industry.\n\nHere is an image of ChatGPT that it generated. What does this tell us?\n\nChatGPT understands that it is a robot that has the ability to think in a way that is limited by its code.\nI then asked, “What decisions did you have to make to create this image” and this is how it responded:\n\nStyle → I leaned toward a flat, simple, cartoon-like design because it’s approachable and clear.\nColors → Neutral beige background with dark blue outlines and white filling to keep it minimalistic and easy to read.\nymbols → A speech bubble (language/communication), lightbulb (ideas/creativity), and gear (technology/process).\nCharacter design → A friendly robot figure with a smile, rounded shapes, and a “AI” label to make it recognizable as an AI, not a human.\n\nThen it said this:\n\nAll of these “choices” came from translating your prompt into visual elements that best match what people might imagine when they picture “an AI like me.”\n\nRather, this image is created from people’s (or rather, users’) image of ChatGPT instead of ChatGPT’s self perception.\nIn conclusion, artificial intelligence—especially large language models—act as a mirror of human imagination, there is a gap between function and perception, and the AI identity is co-constructed."

Future Predictions for Politics (U.S. Focus)\n\nShort-term (1–2 years)\n\nElections and Campaigns: Republican and Democratic campaigns will likely intensify partisan rhetoric, especially with presidential primaries approaching.\nLegislative Gridlock: Expect continued stalemates on key policy areas like budget, immigration, and healthcare unless compromise emerges from coalition-building or public pressure.\nSocial Unrest: Protests and grassroots campaigns may increase, reflecting frustration with entrenched partisanship.\n\n\n\nMedium-term (3–5 years)\n\nShift in Political Demographics: Younger, more progressive voters are becoming a larger share of the electorate. This may gradually tilt some elections, particularly in urban and suburban areas.\nPolicy Innovation: States may experiment more aggressively with policies on climate, digital regulation, and social equity, setting precedents for federal legislation.\nParty Realignment: Ongoing ideological shifts could lead to subtle realignments within the major parties, particularly if centrists or independents gain influence.\n\n\n\nLong-term (5–10 years)\n\nTechnological and Social Influence: AI, social media, and global interconnectedness will increasingly shape campaigns, governance, and civic engagement.\nPolarization Pressure: If unresolved, polarization could lead to structural reforms (e.g., voting system changes, campaign finance reform) or heightened political instability.\nGlobal Role: The U.S.’s ability to influence global politics will hinge on domestic cohesion; persistent internal conflict could reduce its soft and hard power abroad.\n\n\n\n\nSummary Insight\n\nThe U.S. is at a political inflection point. Grassroots activism, demographic shifts, and technological influence are reshaping how politics functions.\nFuture politics will be defined by adaptation: Leaders and parties that respond to polarization, embrace inclusivity, and leverage technology effectively will shape policy and public trust.\nGlobal influence is linked to domestic stability: Internal polarization has a cascading effect internationally, affecting diplomacy, trade, and security.\n\n\nIf you want, I can also create a scenario map predicting likely political trajectories, including best-case, worst-case, and most probable scenarios for the next decade. This could give a clear visual framework for understanding the future of U.S. and global politics.\nDo you want me to make that scenario map?\nI said yes."

    "text": "Introduction\nIn honor of Halloween, I decided to depend on ChatGPT’s creativity and ask it for help. I wanted ChatGPT to generate some costume ideas that I can use for Halloween this year.\nThe prompt I asked ChatGPT was: “Please generate some costume ideas I can use for Halloween this year. Please go with trendy costumes but something that does not require too much effort or props. I want something people can recognize but is not basic.”\n\n\nChatGPT’s Response:\nGot it! You want trendy, recognizable, not too “basic,” and low-effort. Here’s a list of ideas you could pull off without a ton of props:\n\n\nPop Culture / TV & Movies\n\nWednesday Addams (Netflix) – Black dress, white collar, braids. Iconic and easy.\nBarbie from Barbie (2023 movie) – Pink everything, cute sunglasses. Glam but low-effort.\nAI Chatbot/“ChatGPT” – Wear a shirt with code, carry a fake laptop, maybe a speech bubble with “I’m here to help.” Nerdy, topical, and funny.\nWednesday vs. Barbie Mashup – Dark gothic dress + pink accessories. Trendy meme-ready.\nWednesday as a Baddie (meme version) – Black outfit + edgy makeup + oversized blazer.\n\n\n\n\nMusic / Pop Stars\n\nTaylor Swift “Eras Tour” look – Pick one iconic era outfit (like sparkly, glittery, or cowboy boots). Easy to recognize.\nBillie Eilish “Green Hair” Look – Neon hair (wig works), baggy clothes, and chains. Effortless.\nK-Pop Idol Inspired – Oversized blazers, pastel hair, cute accessories. Recognizable to fans but approachable.\n\n\n\n\nInternet / Meme Culture\n\nDalle-Generated AI Art – Print a funny or surreal AI image, tape it to yourself, or carry it as a sign. Hilarious and meta.\nTikTok Trend Costume – Pick a viral dance trend or viral sound (like the “Ratatouille musical” outfit). Recognizable to Gen Z.\n\n\n\n\nSimple, Creative, Low-Effort\n\n“Gossip Girl” Character – Preppy outfits, designer vibes, optional headpiece.\nEuphoria-Inspired Makeup – Neon glitter, bold eyeliner, monochrome clothing. The outfit can be normal clothes; the makeup does the heavy lifting.\nModern Witch or Sorceress – Black outfit + trendy boots + subtle neon accessories. Very versatile.\nCottagecore Fairy – Flowing dress, floral crown, minimal props. Easy, trendy, Instagram-friendly.\n\n\nIf you want, I can make a shortlist of 5 costumes that are the perfect mix of trendy, recognizable, and super low-effort—including exactly what you’d need to buy or already have at home. That way you can literally throw it together in under an hour.\nDo you want me to do that?\nI responded with “Yes, please.”\n\n\n\nChatGPT’s Second Response:\nPerfect! Here’s a handpicked list of 5 trendy, recognizable, low-effort Halloween costumes you can realistically pull off without going overboard on props or time:\n\n\n1. Wednesday Addams (Netflix version)\n\nWhy it works: Extremely recognizable, trending thanks to the show, and minimal effort.\nWhat you need: Black dress (or black top + skirt), white collar (or a collared shirt underneath), braided pigtails, black shoes.\nOptional: Pale makeup or dark lipstick for extra “Wednesday” vibe.\n\n\n\n\n2. Barbie (Barbie 2023 movie)\n\nWhy it works: Iconic, pop-culture relevant, and fun.\nWhat you need: Pink outfit (dress, blazer, or jumpsuit), pink shoes or sneakers, sunglasses, maybe a little glitter.\nOptional: Blonde wig if you want the full Barbie effect.\n\n\n\n\n3. Billie Eilish “Green Hair” Look\n\nWhy it works: Effortless cool-girl vibe, very recognizable among Gen Z.\nWhat you need: Oversized baggy clothes, black sneakers, neon-green (or wig) hair, chains or chunky accessories.\nOptional: Dark nail polish or tinted sunglasses for extra attitude.\n\n\n\n\n4. Euphoria-Inspired Glitter Queen\n\nWhy it works: Trendy, flexible, and basically “wear whatever you want” as long as the makeup pops.\nWhat you need: Normal clothing (jeans + top or simple dress), bold glittery eyeliner, rhinestones or face gems, dramatic highlighter.\nOptional: Colored hair spray or temporary hair chalk.\n\n\n\n\n5. Modern Witch / Trendy Sorceress\n\nWhy it works: Seasonal (Halloween-ready), stylish, and completely low-effort.\nWhat you need: Black outfit (dress, pants + top, or jumpsuit), boots, optional witch hat or jewelry.\nOptional: A statement accessory like a neon broom, moon earrings, or a trendy belt.\n\n\nIf you want, I can also make a “cheat sheet” version with exact stores, colors, and affordable items you could grab online or in your closet, so you could literally assemble one in under 30 minutes. That would make it 100% no-brainer.\nDo you want me to do that?\nI responded with “No.”\n\n\n\nTakeaways and Conclusion\nChatGPT’s response was structured and comprehensive, organizing ideas into clear categories—Pop Culture/TV & Movies, Music/Pop Stars, Internet/Meme Culture, and Simple/Creative Low-Effort. This categorization made it easier for me to process and evaluate options, and the AI suggested costumes that were culturally relevant, like Wednesday Addams (Netflix) and Barbie (2023), demonstrating its awareness of contemporary trends.\nThe AI also considered practical constraints, balancing recognizability with minimal effort. For example, its suggestion of an Euphoria-inspired look relied heavily on makeup rather than elaborate outfits, which suited my goal of a low-effort costume.\nWhen ChatGPT offered to make a shortlist of five “perfect mix” costumes, I confirmed with “Yes, please.” In its follow-up, the AI narrowed the options and provided detailed, actionable guidance for each choice, including optional enhancements and required clothing or props.\nI exercised selective curation by later declining its offer to create a full “cheat sheet” of exact stores and items. This step highlighted that, while the AI is capable of providing detailed logistical support, I preferred to retain creative control and rely on my own wardrobe and resources. This demonstrates that human agency remains central in human-AI creative collaboration.\nThrough this interaction, I observed that ChatGPT acts as a cognitive amplifier: 1. Ideation Expansion – The AI suggested combinations I might not have considered, such as Wednesday vs. Barbie mashups or Euphoria-inspired glitter looks. 2. Contextual Framing – It explained the rationale behind each suggestion, emphasizing recognizability, trendiness, and ease of execution. 3. Trend Integration – The AI leveraged its embedded cultural knowledge to propose costumes that reflect current media and internet trends.\nThe interaction illustrates that AI can provide breadth, structure, and culturally relevant suggestions, but human judgment is still necessary for final selection and contextual fit.\nChatGPT provided structured, culturally informed, and adaptable ideas, but I ultimately shaped the outcome through my preferences, selections, and rejections. The interaction exemplifies a model of human-AI collaboration where AI enhances ideation and organization, while humans maintain creative direction."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nI want ChatGPT to give me a roast that’s personalized, not just a generic joke. I want it to use the knowledge it already has about me, including details from our past conversations, such as my interests, habits, writing style, and personality traits. Essentially, I want it to synthesize what it knows and then craft a roast that feels tailored and specific.\nSo, my prompt for it is: “Using what you know about me, roast me.”\nBelow is ChatGPT’s response:\n\n\nChatGPT’s First Response:\nOh, Emily, you’re the kind of person who meticulously edits other people’s articles for AP style but will spend 20 minutes debating whether “midnight snack” should be hyphenated. You write essays imagining Korea in 2045, yet can’t seem to predict that McDonald’s is going to replace Allegro and that people might actually miss the late-night pizza. And let’s be honest, you’ve probably watched every Ozu and neorealist film known to humanity, but still need a cheat sheet to remember if “first-person focus” counts as a Y or N on a tweet.\nBasically, you’re a cinematic genius with the attention to detail of a hawk… but a hawk that’s still tripping over Twitter columns.\nIf you want, I can do an even nastier version that hits your journalism, cinema, and spreadsheet habits all at once. Do you want me to?\nI responded with “Get even nastier.”\n\n\nChatGPT’s Second Response:\nOhhh, buckle up, Emily. You’re like a walking paradox: you get a 95.5% on your cinematics final and then immediately panic about whether that one tiny point will ruin your life—newsflash, it won’t, but your stress levels definitely will. You’re obsessed with grammar, AP style, and parentheses, yet somehow your life choices scream, “Let’s analyze Tokyo Story instead of sleeping.”\nYou’re the kind of person who will interview students about late-night food but then spend more time questioning if a McDonald’s counts as “cultural research.” You study foreign policy, Italian neorealism, Japanese cinema, and yet somehow your brain freezes when someone asks what’s for dinner. And let’s not forget, you have a whole system for analyzing tweets, hashtags, and first-person focus—but ask you to just relax for five minutes? Impossible.\nBasically, Emily, you’re a human AP Style guide crossed with an over-caffeinated cinephile who’s convinced that spreadsheets are the key to understanding existence. Your brain is brilliant… but it’s also exhausting, even for you.\nIf you want, I can go full roast mode 2.0 and target your journalism, cinema, and spreadsheet obsession in a single merciless paragraph. Do you want me to do that?\nI responded with “Yes.”\n\n\nChatGPT’s Third Response:\nAlright, Emily, here’s the unfiltered roast:\nYou’re like if a human Swiss Army knife had a nervous breakdown—journalist, cinephile, spreadsheet analyst, late-night snack critic—all at once. You’ll fact-check Biden’s letters and debate AP Style for hours, but somehow forget that McDonald’s exists now and that Allegro closing is actually sad. You analyze every frame of Tokyo Story, every line of Bicycle Thieves, and still need a flowchart to figure out whether a tweet counts as “first-person focus.” You dream about Korea in 2045 with environmental utopias, yet your caffeine intake probably rivals the entire population of Penn’s campus. Basically, you’ve turned overthinking into an art form, and somehow made it your career. You’re brilliant, meticulous, and terrifying—but also the kind of person who would calculate the standard deviation of a single snack choice just to feel alive.\nIf you want, I can write an even more savage version that’s short, brutal, and would make a roast comedian blush. Do you want me to?\nI decided to end the roast session here.\n\n\nFinal Thoughts and Takeaways\nThis roast session was hilarious and a reminder that ChatGPT knows me from the converations we have but does not really know me. Using ChatGPT’s memory of my habits, interests, and quirks—from obsessing over AP Style and cinematics exams to late-night snack research—made each roast feel personal and specific, not just some generic joke. Yet, because these conversations are more about my academic life rather than my personal life, it felt like ChatGPT does not know me on a deeper level.\nSome of my thoughts: 1. Personalization is everything. The more ChatGPT knew about me, the sharper and funnier the jokes became. References to my cinephile tendencies, obsession with flowcharts, and even my caffeine intake made the roasts hit in a way generic humor never could. 2. Funny, not mean. The roasts exaggerated my quirks—overthinking, analyzing everything, and turning spreadsheets into life tools—but still celebrated my strengths, like my meticulousness and curiosity. 3. Escalation is key. Each round got “nastier,” piling on multiple layers of jokes about journalism, cinema, and snack habits. It was like watching a roast evolve from playful teasing to full-blown comedic chaos. 4. Self-awareness makes it work. The roast worked because I recognize these traits in myself. It’s funny to see your own perfectionism and quirks reflected back in an over-the-top way.\nYet I wanted ChatGPT to get meaner. When I kept asking it to get “nastier” and “go deeper” using information it hasn’t used in its previous responses, it kept repeating the same jokes. It seems ChatGPT was not creative."

Because LLMs don’t create from lived experience, emotional depth, or a true understanding of context, they are unable to generate creative or original experiences. That is why they generate based on patterns in their training data.\nAnother limitation is coherence across long works. Sustaining a novel-length text usually exposes weaknesses: repetitive phrasing and plotlines without purpose."

    "text": "Why It Matters\nLLMs are incredible tools for sparking ideas, drafting first versions, or even playing or experimenting with language. But the “soul” of creativity that is rooted in perspective and genuine insight still belongs to humans.\nThis is an example that ChatGPT generated when prompted:\n\nHowever, as evidently shown by this AI-generated picture, there is not a significant difference.\nSo, what does this tell us about AI’s creativity and humans’ genuine creativity? Can creativity truly be replicated? If so, what does this tell us about the future of humanity?\n\nFirst of all, what is the difference between artifical creativity and genuine creativity? This is what ChatGPT said:\n\nDo you agree with it?\nSecond, when asked if creativity can be replicated, this is what ChatGPT said:\n\nMy opinion is that creativity is objectively subjective. While the path that humanity will walk alongside with artificial intelligence is still obscure, it is safe to tell that AI will never fully replace the human impulse to create, but will inevitably reshape how we deifne and practice creativity. Machines can generate works that surprise and delight us but the meaning we attach to those works—and the emotional depth that inspires them—remains uniquely human.\nThe future, then, is not a contest between artificial and genuine creativity, but a collaboration that forces us to rethink what it means to make something truly original."
