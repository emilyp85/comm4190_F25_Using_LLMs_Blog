    "text": "What I think about ChatGPT as a LLM\nI believe that ChatGPT is a very useful tool but it has many limitations. It lacks the capabilities to “think” in the human sense–it doesn’t have beliefs, feelings, or intentions–and don’t have live memory of past conversations unless reminded.\nWhen taken with a grain of salt, ChatGPT makes a great conversation partner that can expand on your ideas and help you see the bigger picture.\nOver time, however, large language models will come to hold influence in every aspect of life, in every field or industry.\n\nHere is an image of ChatGPT that it generated. What does this tell us?\n\nChatGPT understands that it is a robot that has the ability to think in a way that is limited by its code.\nI then asked, “What decisions did you have to make to create this image” and this is how it responded:\n\nStyle → I leaned toward a flat, simple, cartoon-like design because it’s approachable and clear.\nColors → Neutral beige background with dark blue outlines and white filling to keep it minimalistic and easy to read.\nymbols → A speech bubble (language/communication), lightbulb (ideas/creativity), and gear (technology/process).\nCharacter design → A friendly robot figure with a smile, rounded shapes, and a “AI” label to make it recognizable as an AI, not a human.\n\nThen it said this:\n\nAll of these “choices” came from translating your prompt into visual elements that best match what people might imagine when they picture “an AI like me.”\n\nRather, this image is created from people’s (or rather, users’) image of ChatGPT instead of ChatGPT’s self perception.\nIn conclusion, artificial intelligence—especially large language models—act as a mirror of human imagination, there is a gap between function and perception, and the AI identity is co-constructed."

    "text": "Where the Limits Show\nBut when it comes to originality, AI’s creative edge dulls. Because LLMs don’t create from lived experience, emotional depth, or a true understanding of context, they are unable to generate creative or original experiences. That is why they generate based on patterns in their training data.\nAnother limitation is coherence across long works. Sustaining a novel-length text usually exposes weaknesses: repetitive phrasing and plotlines without purpose."

    "text": "Why It Matters\nLLMs are incredible tools for sparking ideas, drafting first versions, or even playing or experimenting with language. But the “soul” of creativity that is rooted in perspective and genuine insight still belongs to humans.\nThis is an example that ChatGPT generated when prompted:\n\nHowever, as evidently shown by this AI-generated picture, there is not a significant difference.\nSo, what does this tell us about AI’s creativity and humans’ genuine creativity? Can creativity truly be replicated? If so, what does this tell us about the future of humanity?\n\nFirst of all, what is the difference between artifical creativity and genuine creativity? This is what ChatGPT said:\n\nDo you agree with it?\nSecond, when asked if creativity can be replicated, this is what ChatGPT said:\n\nMy opinion is that creativity is objectively subjective. While the path that humanity will walk alongside with artificial intelligence is still obscure, it is safe to tell that AI will never fully replace the human impulse to create, but will inevitably reshape how we deifne and practice creativity. Machines can generate works that surprise and delight us but the meaning we attach to those works—and the emotional depth that inspires them—remains uniquely human.\nThe future, then, is not a contest between artificial and genuine creativity, but a collaboration that forces us to rethink what it means to make something truly original."

    "title": "Can ChatGPT solve NYT’s Connections Game?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I play Connections almost every morning. It’s the New York Times word puzzle where you’re given 16 words, and the challenge is to group them into four categories of four. Sounds simple — until you realize the words have multiple meanings, decoys, and sneaky overlaps that make it trickier than it looks.\nThis time, I decided to test a new teammate: ChatGPT. Could it solve the puzzle faster than I could?\n\nInput the Command\nI wanted to see if ChatGPT can solve the New York Times Connections Game. Thus, I copied the day’s words into ChatGPT with a single prompt.\nCan you solve the NYT connections game? Here are the words:\nBANK, COAST, SHORE, STRAND, CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, FIREWORKS, SPARK, CARPET, LAMINATE, TILE, WOOD, BANSHEE, HEARTBREAKER, PIP, WAILER\nChatGPT thought for a few seconds and then gave me this:\nThought for 13s\n\nNice — here's a clean solve with groups and category names:\n\nGroups\n\nShore / Edge (coastline/banks)\nBANK, COAST, SHORE, STRAND\n\nRomantic spark / chemistry (things that signal attraction)\nCHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, SPARK, FIREWORKS\n\nFlooring materials\nCARPET, LAMINATE, TILE, WOOD\n\nBand-name roots (singular forms of group names used in band names: The ___s)\nBANSHEE, HEARTBREAKER, PIP, WAILER\n\nWant me to explain any one group in more detail?\n\n\nTesting It Out\nI typed these into the game. And… it worked! All four groups, correct.\n\n\n\nHow It Solved It\nWhen I asked ChatGPT how it reached the answer, it broke its process down step by step:\nNice — here's a clear, non-secret walkthrough of how I solved it.\n\n1. **Look for obvious semantic clusters.**\n   I scanned the full list for small groups of words that share a single, simple meaning. Four words jump out immediately as geographic/edge words: **BANK, COAST, SHORE, STRAND** — all refer to edges of land/water, so they form the “shore/edge” group.\n\n2. **Spot metaphorical/figurative connections.**\n   Some words weren’t literal but are commonly used as metaphors for the same idea. **CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, SPARK, FIREWORKS** are all used to describe romantic or interpersonal attraction (e.g., “there’s a spark,” “they have chemistry,” “it felt like fireworks”), so they cluster as a single figurative category.\n\n3. **Group by concrete category / function.**\n   **CARPET, LAMINATE, TILE, WOOD** are all flooring materials — a tidy, concrete category that’s easy to see once you notice two or three of them.\n\n4. **Recognize cultural/name patterns.**\n   The last four required a bit of cultural knowledge: **BANSHEE, HEARTBREAKER, PIP, WAILER** all appear in band names (or groups): e.g., *Siouxsie and the Banshees*, *Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers*, *Gladys Knight & The Pips*, *Bob Marley & The Wailers*. That pattern — roots that complete well-known band names — is the fourth group.\n\n5. **Check for overlap or alternate fits.**\n   After grouping, I scanned for words that might belong to more than one group and chose the group where the meaning is strongest and clearest. Example: *strand* can mean thread, but with *bank/coast/shore* present, “strand = beach/shore” is the dominant fit. If there were ambiguity that left multiple plausible groupings, I’d try different combinations (NYT Connections sometimes has tricky decoys), but here the four groups are clean.\n\nThat’s it — a mix of looking for tight literal sets, spotting figurative uses, and recognizing cultural naming conventions. Want me to try a different valid category name for any group (e.g., a snappier label for the band group)?\n\nThat’s not far off from how a human would explain their own reasoning — but instead of trial and error on the board and using up limited attempts, the AI laid out categories almost instantly.\n\n\nAI vs. Human Play Style\nWhat struck me is how differently AI and humans approach the same puzzle:\n\nHumans often guess, regroup, and backtrack when categories overlap.\nChatGPT skipped the guessing and presented neat, confident sets, backed with cultural references and metaphors.\n\nIt didn’t feel like it was “playing” so much as sorting words into buckets based on context clues it had seen before.\nChatGPT’s categories were perfect this time, but what impressed me was its confidence. Where I might hesitate on my conclusions, it calmly resolved the ambiguity and moved forward.\nThe cultural (the hardest!) category was the most surprising. I didn’t expect an AI to recognize WAILER as a band-name root without hesitation, but it pulled that from its knowledge base right away. Even I didn’t know that those group of words could form a category.\n\n\nShould You Play with an AI Teammate?\nWould I use ChatGPT every day to “cheat” at Connections? Probably not — that would ruin the fun. But it was fascinating to see how it thinks through puzzles like this.\nIt also raises a bigger question: was this “reasoning” or just sophisticated pattern-matching? To me, it felt like a blend. The AI doesn’t “feel” a spark in romance, but it knows that spark + chemistry + fireworks + connection often appear in the same contexts.\nThis made me wonder — how well could ChatGPT handle other NYT puzzles? Wordle seems too easy, but what about Spelling Bee? Or even the Mini Crossword? Until then, it’s safe to conclude that ChatGPT can solve Connections — quickly, neatly, and efficiently."
