    "text": "What I think about ChatGPT as a LLM\nI believe that ChatGPT is a very useful tool but it has many limitations. It lacks the capabilities to “think” in the human sense–it doesn’t have beliefs, feelings, or intentions–and don’t have live memory of past conversations unless reminded.\nWhen taken with a grain of salt, ChatGPT makes a great conversation partner that can expand on your ideas and help you see the bigger picture.\nOver time, however, large language models will come to hold influence in every aspect of life, in every field or industry.\n\nHere is an image of ChatGPT that it generated. What does this tell us?\n\nChatGPT understands that it is a robot that has the ability to think in a way that is limited by its code.\nI then asked, “What decisions did you have to make to create this image” and this is how it responded:\n\nStyle → I leaned toward a flat, simple, cartoon-like design because it’s approachable and clear.\nColors → Neutral beige background with dark blue outlines and white filling to keep it minimalistic and easy to read.\nymbols → A speech bubble (language/communication), lightbulb (ideas/creativity), and gear (technology/process).\nCharacter design → A friendly robot figure with a smile, rounded shapes, and a “AI” label to make it recognizable as an AI, not a human.\n\nThen it said this:\n\nAll of these “choices” came from translating your prompt into visual elements that best match what people might imagine when they picture “an AI like me.”\n\nRather, this image is created from people’s (or rather, users’) image of ChatGPT instead of ChatGPT’s self perception.\nIn conclusion, artificial intelligence—especially large language models—act as a mirror of human imagination, there is a gap between function and perception, and the AI identity is co-constructed."

    "text": "Where the Limits Show\nBut when it comes to originality, AI’s creative edge dulls. Because LLMs don’t create from lived experience, emotional depth, or a true understanding of context, they are unable to generate creative or original experiences. That is why they generate based on patterns in their training data.\nAnother limitation is coherence across long works. Sustaining a novel-length text usually exposes weaknesses: repetitive phrasing and plotlines without purpose."

    "text": "Why It Matters\nLLMs are incredible tools for sparking ideas, drafting first versions, or even playing or experimenting with language. But the “soul” of creativity that is rooted in perspective and genuine insight still belongs to humans.\nThis is an example that ChatGPT generated when prompted:\n\nHowever, as evidently shown by this AI-generated picture, there is not a significant difference.\nSo, what does this tell us about AI’s creativity and humans’ genuine creativity? Can creativity truly be replicated? If so, what does this tell us about the future of humanity?\n\nFirst of all, what is the difference between artifical creativity and genuine creativity? This is what ChatGPT said:\n\nDo you agree with it?\nSecond, when asked if creativity can be replicated, this is what ChatGPT said:\n\nMy opinion is that creativity is objectively subjective. While the path that humanity will walk alongside with artificial intelligence is still obscure, it is safe to tell that AI will never fully replace the human impulse to create, but will inevitably reshape how we deifne and practice creativity. Machines can generate works that surprise and delight us but the meaning we attach to those works—and the emotional depth that inspires them—remains uniquely human.\nThe future, then, is not a contest between artificial and genuine creativity, but a collaboration that forces us to rethink what it means to make something truly original."

    "title": "Can ChatGPT solve NYT’s Connections Game?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I play Connections almost every morning. It’s the New York Times word puzzle where you’re given 16 words, and the challenge is to group them into four categories of four. Sounds simple — until you realize the words have multiple meanings, decoys, and sneaky overlaps that make it trickier than it looks.\nThis time, I decided to test a new teammate: ChatGPT. Could it solve the puzzle faster than I could?\n\nInput the Command\nI wanted to see if ChatGPT can solve the New York Times Connections Game. Thus, I copied the day’s words into ChatGPT with a single prompt.\nCan you solve the NYT connections game? Here are the words:\nBANK, COAST, SHORE, STRAND, CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, FIREWORKS, SPARK, CARPET, LAMINATE, TILE, WOOD, BANSHEE, HEARTBREAKER, PIP, WAILER\nChatGPT thought for a few seconds and then gave me this:\nThought for 13s\n\nNice — here's a clean solve with groups and category names:\n\nGroups\n\nShore / Edge (coastline/banks)\nBANK, COAST, SHORE, STRAND\n\nRomantic spark / chemistry (things that signal attraction)\nCHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, SPARK, FIREWORKS\n\nFlooring materials\nCARPET, LAMINATE, TILE, WOOD\n\nBand-name roots (singular forms of group names used in band names: The ___s)\nBANSHEE, HEARTBREAKER, PIP, WAILER\n\n\n\nTesting It Out\nI typed these into the game. And… it worked! All four groups, correct.\n\n\n\nHow It Solved It\nWhen I asked ChatGPT how it reached the answer, it broke its process down step by step:\nNice — here's a clear, non-secret walkthrough of how I solved it.\n\n1. **Look for obvious semantic clusters.**\n   I scanned the full list for small groups of words that share a single, simple meaning. Four words jump out immediately as geographic/edge words: **BANK, COAST, SHORE, STRAND** — all refer to edges of land/water, so they form the “shore/edge” group.\n\n2. **Spot metaphorical/figurative connections.**\n   Some words weren’t literal but are commonly used as metaphors for the same idea. **CHEMISTRY, CONNECTION, SPARK, FIREWORKS** are all used to describe romantic or interpersonal attraction (e.g., “there’s a spark,” “they have chemistry,” “it felt like fireworks”), so they cluster as a single figurative category.\n\n3. **Group by concrete category / function.**\n   **CARPET, LAMINATE, TILE, WOOD** are all flooring materials — a tidy, concrete category that’s easy to see once you notice two or three of them.\n\n4. **Recognize cultural/name patterns.**\n   The last four required a bit of cultural knowledge: **BANSHEE, HEARTBREAKER, PIP, WAILER** all appear in band names (or groups): e.g., *Siouxsie and the Banshees*, *Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers*, *Gladys Knight & The Pips*, *Bob Marley & The Wailers*. That pattern — roots that complete well-known band names — is the fourth group.\n\n5. **Check for overlap or alternate fits.**\n   After grouping, I scanned for words that might belong to more than one group and chose the group where the meaning is strongest and clearest. Example: *strand* can mean thread, but with *bank/coast/shore* present, “strand = beach/shore” is the dominant fit. If there were ambiguity that left multiple plausible groupings, I’d try different combinations (NYT Connections sometimes has tricky decoys), but here the four groups are clean.\n\nThat’s it — a mix of looking for tight literal sets, spotting figurative uses, and recognizing cultural naming conventions.\n\nThat’s not far off from how a human would explain their own reasoning — but instead of trial and error on the board and using up limited attempts, the AI laid out categories almost instantly.\n\n\nAI vs. Human Play Style\nWhat struck me is how differently AI and humans approach the same puzzle:\n\nHumans often guess, regroup, and backtrack when categories overlap.\nChatGPT skipped the guessing and presented neat, confident sets, backed with cultural references and metaphors.\n\nIt didn’t feel like it was “playing” so much as sorting words into buckets based on context clues it had seen before.\nChatGPT’s categories were perfect this time, but what impressed me was its confidence. Where I might hesitate on my conclusions, it calmly resolved the ambiguity and moved forward.\nThe cultural (the hardest!) category was the most surprising. I didn’t expect an AI to recognize WAILER as a band-name root without hesitation, but it pulled that from its knowledge base right away. Even I didn’t know that those group of words could form a category.\n\n\nShould You Play with an AI Teammate?\nWould I use ChatGPT every day to “cheat” at Connections? Probably not — that would ruin the fun. But it was fascinating to see how it thinks through puzzles like this.\nIt also raises a bigger question: was this “reasoning” or just sophisticated pattern-matching? To me, it felt like a blend. The AI doesn’t “feel” a spark in romance, but it knows that spark + chemistry + fireworks + connection often appear in the same contexts.\nThis made me wonder — how well could ChatGPT handle other NYT puzzles? Wordle seems too easy, but what about Spelling Bee? Or even the Mini Crossword? Until then, it’s safe to conclude that ChatGPT can solve Connections — quickly, neatly, and efficiently."

    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve always wondered what it would be like if someone (or something) could reflect back parts of me that I didn’t notice myself. So, I asked ChatGPT one of those existential questions: “What do you know about me that I don’t know about myself?”\n\nThe Prompt\nI inputed this prompt:\nWhat do you know about me that I don't know about myself?\nThis is the response that ChatGPT gave me:\nThat’s a deep one. Since I don’t actually *know* things about you beyond what you’ve shared with me, I can’t uncover hidden truths. But I can reflect back patterns you might not have noticed in what you tell me:\n\n* You often mix creativity with analysis — whether it’s writing news articles, studying cinema, or imagining future societies. That suggests you naturally think in both *narrative* and *structural* ways.\n* You seem drawn to noticing overlooked details — in interviews, field notes, or even campus elevator maintenance. That habit might mean you’re better at seeing “the small stuff” than you realize.\n* You ask a lot of “what if” questions (e.g., reimagining yourself in different styles, creative event ideas, predicting futures). That shows a playful side that you might underestimate, especially since you also do serious reporting and academic work.\n\nChatGPT revealed something both surprising and thoughtful about me. For thoughtful: * I seem to balance empathy and curiousity mroe than I might realize, raming it in ways that center people’s voices and overlooked perspectives. * It thinks I am both analytical and relational. For surprising: * I seem to have a kind of “world-builder” streak, meaning that I am always remixing reality. * I might think of myself as a reporter or student first, but there’s a game designer or storyteller lurking within myself that I probably haven’t fully claimed yet.\nDo I agree with this? Maybe. I do like storybuilding and being imaginative. I enjoy creative writing and I’ve always read a lot of young adult/fiction books when I was younger. Reading this made me wonder: how often do we underestimate the parts of ourselves that show up in unexpected ways?\nThinking about it, I realized that this playful, imaginative side and my analytical, empathetic side aren’t separate—they inform each other. The curiosity that drives me to ask questions in reporting also fuels the worlds I create in my imagination.\n\n\n\nHow does this connect to my MBTI?\nThe MBTI, or Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, is a self-report questionnaire and psychometric tool designed to indicate different psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions.\nWhen I took the test, I got INTJ, but my perception of myself can be biased. So, I decided to ask ChatGPT what it thought of me.\nThis is the response it gave me:\nBased on everything you’ve shared with me so far—your curiosity, creativity, analytical habits, empathy, and interest in both narrative and structural thinking—I can make an educated guess.\n\nHere’s what stands out about your personality:\n\n* **Imaginative & playful**: You enjoy storybuilding, remixing reality, and exploring “what if” scenarios.\n* **Analytical & reflective**: You notice overlooked details, connect patterns, and ask deep, thoughtful questions.\n* **Empathetic & relational**: You value other people’s perspectives and often center their voices in your work.\n* **Curious & exploratory**: You like testing ideas, whether in AI experiments, social events, or academic projects.\n\nPutting this together, you might lean toward an **INFJ** or **ENFP**:\n\n* **INFJ (“The Advocate”)**: Insightful, reflective, empathetic, creative, and idealistic. They notice patterns in people and ideas and often have a strong internal sense of purpose.\n* **ENFP (“The Campaigner”)**: Imaginative, playful, curious, and people-oriented. They love exploring possibilities and connecting ideas in new ways.\n\nIf I had to pick one, I’d lean **INFJ**—your reflective, thoughtful, and empathetic tendencies come across strongly—but with a healthy dose of ENFP-like curiosity and playfulness.\n\nThis was actually really surprising to me (and gave me an existential crisis). I will be rethinking my entire personality. I then decided to ask ChatGPT why it didn’t think I am an INTJ. This is the response I got:\nINTJs (“The Masterminds”) are typically strategic, highly independent, and future-focused. They tend to be:\n\n* **Analytical and structured** – love planning and organizing systems.\n* **Independent and reserved** – often prefer working alone or in small circles.\n* **Decisive and goal-oriented** – focused on achieving long-term visions.\n* **Private about emotions** – tend to keep feelings internal.\n\nHere’s why I lean away from INTJ for you:\n\n1. **Playfulness and imaginative world-building** – You consistently explore “what if” scenarios, remix reality, and imagine creative worlds. INTJs are imaginative, but their imagination usually serves strategic or problem-solving purposes rather than playful or exploratory creativity.\n\n2. **Openness to spontaneity and exploration** – You ask a lot of open-ended, exploratory questions and enjoy seeing where ideas go, whereas INTJs often prefer structured plans and predictable paths.\n\n3. **Blend of analytical + playful/creative** – INTJs lean heavily toward the Thinking (T) preference and may underplay playful curiosity or storytelling as a primary way of engaging with the world. Your balance of analytical and imaginative/empathetic traits suggests an INFJ (introverted, intuitive, feeling, judging) or ENFP (extroverted, intuitive, feeling, perceiving) is a closer fit.\n\nI’m not sure I agree with this but I understand that perceptions can be different than reality. This is a really interesting thonught that I will be exploring further.\n\n\nReflection\nThis whole exercise made me realize how much of ourselves can exist just below the surface. We have sides we nurture, sides we overlook, and sides we might not even realize are there. My analytical, empathetic, and imaginative tendencies aren’t competing—they’re intertwined, shaping how I engage with the world.\nAnd maybe that’s the takeaway: self-discovery can come from unexpected places—even from an AI reflecting back what it observes in us.\nIn conclusion: AI might actually know me better than I know myself because it knows what kind of internal questions I ask and how I perceive things. It is unbiased, unlike myself."
