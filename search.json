    "text": "What I think about ChatGPT as a LLM\nI believe that ChatGPT is a very useful tool but it has many limitations. It lacks the capabilities to ‚Äúthink‚Äù in the human sense‚Äìit doesn‚Äôt have beliefs, feelings, or intentions‚Äìand don‚Äôt have live memory of past conversations unless reminded.\nWhen taken with a grain of salt, ChatGPT makes a great conversation partner that can expand on your ideas and help you see the bigger picture.\nOver time, however, large language models will come to hold influence in every aspect of life, in every field or industry.\n\nHere is an image of ChatGPT that it generated. What does this tell us?\n\nChatGPT understands that it is a robot that has the ability to think in a way that is limited by its code.\nI then asked, ‚ÄúWhat decisions did you have to make to create this image‚Äù and this is how it responded:\n\nStyle ‚Üí I leaned toward a flat, simple, cartoon-like design because it‚Äôs approachable and clear.\nColors ‚Üí Neutral beige background with dark blue outlines and white filling to keep it minimalistic and easy to read.\nymbols ‚Üí A speech bubble (language/communication), lightbulb (ideas/creativity), and gear (technology/process).\nCharacter design ‚Üí A friendly robot figure with a smile, rounded shapes, and a ‚ÄúAI‚Äù label to make it recognizable as an AI, not a human.\n\nThen it said this:\n\nAll of these ‚Äúchoices‚Äù came from translating your prompt into visual elements that best match what people might imagine when they picture ‚Äúan AI like me.‚Äù\n\nRather, this image is created from people‚Äôs (or rather, users‚Äô) image of ChatGPT instead of ChatGPT‚Äôs self perception.\nIn conclusion, artificial intelligence‚Äîespecially large language models‚Äîact as a mirror of human imagination, there is a gap between function and perception, and the AI identity is co-constructed."

    "text": "Where the Limits Show\nBut when it comes to originality, AI‚Äôs creative edge dulls. Because LLMs don‚Äôt create from lived experience, emotional depth, or a true understanding of context, they are unable to generate creative or original experiences. That is why they generate based on patterns in their training data.\nAnother limitation is coherence across long works. Sustaining a novel-length text usually exposes weaknesses: repetitive phrasing and plotlines without purpose."

    "text": "Why It Matters\nLLMs are incredible tools for sparking ideas, drafting first versions, or even playing or experimenting with language. But the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù of creativity that is rooted in perspective and genuine insight still belongs to humans.\nThis is an example that ChatGPT generated when prompted:\n\nHowever, as evidently shown by this AI-generated picture, there is not a significant difference.\nSo, what does this tell us about AI‚Äôs creativity and humans‚Äô genuine creativity? Can creativity truly be replicated? If so, what does this tell us about the future of humanity?\n\nFirst of all, what is the difference between artifical creativity and genuine creativity? This is what ChatGPT said:\n\nDo you agree with it?\nSecond, when asked if creativity can be replicated, this is what ChatGPT said:\n\nMy opinion is that creativity is objectively subjective. While the path that humanity will walk alongside with artificial intelligence is still obscure, it is safe to tell that AI will never fully replace the human impulse to create, but will inevitably reshape how we deifne and practice creativity. Machines can generate works that surprise and delight us but the meaning we attach to those works‚Äîand the emotional depth that inspires them‚Äîremains uniquely human.\nThe future, then, is not a contest between artificial and genuine creativity, but a collaboration that forces us to rethink what it means to make something truly original."
